Creating images

Creating images could be a challenging task. The goal of this library
is to help you out with basic tasks. You can easily generate very basic
graphic images, but no custom shapes. Paper size is A4.

If you don't like how PDF files are generated by this library, you can
check the `faker-file`_ package, which can produce pretty comprehensive PDFs.

Supported image formats
-----------------------
Currently, 4 image formats are supported:

- ``PNG``.
- ``SVG``.
- ``BMP``.
- ``GIF``.

Generating images as bytes
--------------------------
See the following full functional snippet for generating images using `imgkit`_.

.. container:: jsphinx-download

    .. literalinclude:: _static/examples/creating_images/imgkit_1.py
        :language: python

    *See the full example*
    :download:`here <_static/examples/creating_images/imgkit_1.py>`

The generated PNG image will have 10,000 characters of text. The generated image
will be as wide as needed to fit those 10,000 characters, but newlines are
respected.

----

If you want image to be less wide, set value of ``wrap_chars_after`` to 80
characters (or any other number that fits your needs). See the example below:

.. container:: jsphinx-download

    .. literalinclude:: _static/examples/creating_images/imgkit_2.py
        :language: python
        :lines: 8-

    *See the full example*
    :download:`here <_static/examples/creating_images/imgkit_2.py>`

Generating files
----------------

To have a longer text, increase the value of ``max_nb_chars`` accordingly.
See the example below:

.. container:: jsphinx-download

    .. literalinclude:: _static/examples/creating_images/imgkit_3.py
        :language: python
        :lines: 8-

    *See the full example*
    :download:`here <_static/examples/creating_images/imgkit_3.py>`
