Developer prerequisites
-----------------------
pre-commit
~~~~~~~~~~
Refer to `pre-commit`_ for installation instructions.

TL;DR:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install pipx --user  # Install pipx
    pipx install pre-commit  # Install pre-commit
    pre-commit install  # Install pre-commit hooks

Installing `pre-commit`_ will ensure you adhere to the project code quality
standards.

Code standards
--------------
`black`_, `isort`_, `ruff`_ and `doc8`_ will be automatically triggered by
`pre-commit`_. Still, if you want to run checks manually:

.. code-block:: sh

    make black
    make doc8
    make isort
    make ruff

Requirements
------------
Requirements are compiled using `pip-tools`_.

.. code-block:: sh

    make compile-requirements

Virtual environment
-------------------
You are advised to work in virtual environment.

TL;DR:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -m venv env
    pip install -e .[all]

Documentation
-------------
Check `documentation`_.

Testing
-------
Check `testing`_.

If you introduce changes or fixes, make sure to test them locally using
all supported environments. For that use tox.

.. code-block:: sh

    tox

In any case, GitHub Actions will catch potential errors, but using tox speeds
things up.

Pull requests
-------------
You can contribute to the project by making a `pull request`_.

For example:

- To fix documentation typos.
- To improve documentation (for instance, to add new recipe or fix
  an existing recipe that doesn't seem to work).
- To introduce a new feature (for instance, add support for a non-supported
  file type).

**Good to know:**

- This library consists of a single ``fake.py`` module. That module is
  dependency free, self-contained (includes all tests) and portable.
  Do not submit pull requests splitting the ``fake.py`` module into small
  parts.
- Some tests contain simplified implementation of existing libraries (Django
  ORM, TortoiseORM, SQLAlchemy). If you need to add integration tests for
  existing functionality, you can add the relevant code and requirements
  to the examples, along with tests. Currently, all integration tests
  are running in the CI against the latest version of Python.

**General list to go through:**

- Does your change require documentation update?
- Does your change require update to tests?
- Does your change rely on third-party package or a cloud based service?
  If so, please consider turning it into a dedicated standalone package,
  since this library is dependency free (and will always stay so).

**When fixing bugs (in addition to the general list):**

- Make sure to add regression tests.

**When adding a new feature (in addition to the general list):**

- Make sure to update the documentation (check whether the `installation`_,
  `features`_, `recipes`_ and `quick start`_ require changes).

Questions
---------
Questions can be asked on GitHub `discussions`_.

Issues
------
For reporting a bug or filing a feature request use GitHub `issues`_.

**Do not report security issues on GitHub**. Check the `support`_ section.
