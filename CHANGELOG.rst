Release history and notes
=========================

`Sequence based identifiers
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Sequence-based_identifiers>`_
are used for versioning (schema follows below):

.. code-block:: text

    major.minor[.revision]

- It's always safe to upgrade within the same minor version (for example, from
  0.3 to 0.3.4).
- Minor version changes might be backwards incompatible. Read the
  release notes carefully before upgrading (for example, when upgrading from
  0.3.4 to 0.4).
- All backwards incompatible changes are mentioned in this document.

  .. code-block:: python

      from fake import FAKER
      from fakepy.pathy_storage.aws_s3 import AWSS3Storage

      STORAGE = AWSS3Storage(
          bucket_name="bucket_name",
          root_path="tmp",  # Optional
          rel_path="sub-tmp",  # Optional
      )

      txt_file = FAKER.txt_file(storage=STORAGE)

      STORAGE.exists(txt_file)
